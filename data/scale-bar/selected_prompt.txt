For each size descriptor in the following figure caption, extract:
1. **Descriptor Type** (e.g., Magnification, Scale Bar, etc.)
2. **Value** and **Units** (e.g., 100x, 50 microns)
3. **Notes** (full description from the caption)
4. **Panel** (the panel number or identifier)

Ensure that the **Panel** is accurately aligned with the corresponding size descriptor, value, and units.

Output format:
{
  "Descriptor Type": "<descriptor type>",
  "Value": "<value>",
  "Units": "<units>",
  "Notes": "<full description>",
  "Panel": "<panel>"
}
