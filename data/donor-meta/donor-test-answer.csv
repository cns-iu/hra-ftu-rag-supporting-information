However, IT will also have an influence on the related jejunum and ileum function. The aim of this research was to investigate the morphology of the jejunum and transposed ileum with the use of light and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in order to determine the local alternations in the intestine resulting from the transposition.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id=""Par2"">Twenty male, 8-week-old, obese Zucker rats underwent IT and six of them sham surgery. To compare both groups, the transection was made at all corresponding ileum positions among both groups of animals. The ileal anastomoses among the rats of sham procedure were subsequently formed accordingly without IT. Three months following the surgery, the tissue samples of jejunum and ileum were harvested.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id=""Par3"">A significant increase in villus length, a decrease in the crypt depth, and an increased thickness of mucosa-muscularis-serosa (MMS) as well as cellular hyperplasia, with increased mitochondrial density of the transposed ileum segment, were observed among the group of rats which underwent IT comparing to the ones undergoing sham surgery. In rats undergoing IT, microvillus degeneration in jejunum regions was observed.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id=""Par4"">Ileal transposition alters the morphology and ultrastructure of the ileum as well as the jejunum. Given that the microvillus membrane represents an important aspect of the enterocyte functions, a further biochemical and molecular research is necessary in order to assess whether the observed changes are beneficial or not and to explore the phenomenon of gut adaptability after metabolic surgery.</p></sec></abstract>","[

abstract,3,,PMC5968881,"<abstract><p>Grinding is a key physical element in America＊s Cup sailing. This study aimed to describe kinematics and muscle activation patterns in relation to torque applied in forward and backward grinding. Ten male America＊s Cup sailors (33.6 ㊣ 5.7 years, 97.9 ㊣ 13.4 kg, 186.6 ㊣ 7.4 cm) completed forward and backward grinding on a customised grinding ergometer. In forward grinding peak torque (77 Nm) occurred at 95∼ (0∼ = crank vertically up) on the downward section of the rotation at the end of shoulder flexion and elbow extension. Backward grinding torque peaked at 35∼ (69 Nm) following the pull action (shoulder extension, elbow flexion) across the top of the rotation. During forward grinding, relatively high levels of torque (&gt;50 Nm) were maintained through the majority (72%) of the cycle, compared to 47% for backward grinding, with sections of low torque corresponding with low numbers of active muscles. Variation in torque was negatively associated with forward grinding performance (<italic>r</italic> = ?0.60; 90% CI ?0.88 to ?0.02), but positively associated with backward performance (<italic>r</italic> = 0.48; CI = ?0.15 to 0.83).

The knockdown of <italic>Ifitm1</italic> in mouse embryos provided evidence for a role in somitogenesis. We generated the first targeted knockin allele of the <italic>Ifitm1</italic> gene to systematically reassess all inferred functions. Sperm motility and the fertility of male and female mutant mice are as in wild type littermates. Embryonic somites and the adult vertebral column appear normal in homozygous <italic>Ifitm1</italic> knockout mice, demonstrating that <italic>Ifitm1</italic> is not essential for normal segmentation of the paraxial mesoderm. Proportions of leucocyte subsets, including granulocytes, monocytes, B-cells, T-cells, NK-cells, and NKT-cells, are unchanged in mutant mice. Based on a normal immune response to <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> infection, there is no evidence for a dysfunction in downstream IFN污 signaling in <italic>Ifitm1</italic> mutant mice. Expression from the <italic>Ifitm1</italic> locus from E8.5 to E14.5 is highly dynamic. In contrast, in adult mice, <italic>Ifitm1</italic> expression is highly restricted and strong in the bronchial epithelium. Intriguingly, IFITM1 is highly overexpressed in tumor epithelia cells of human squamous cell carcinomas and in adenocarcinomas of NSCLC patients. These analyses underline the general importance of targeted <italic>in vivo</italic> studies for the functional annotation of the mammalian genome. The first comprehensive description of the <italic>Ifitm1</italic> expression pattern provides a rational basis for the further examination of <italic>Ifitm1</italic> gene functions. Based on our data, the fact that IFITM1 can function as a negative regulator of cell proliferation, and because the gene maps to chromosome band 11p15.5, previously associated with NSCLC, it is likely that IFITM1 in man has a key role in tumor formation.</p></abstract>","[

abstract,6,,PMC10101451,"<abstract><p>To accurately assess pain and support broadly-based analgesic protocols to mitigate swine pain, it is imperative to develop and validate a species-specific pain scale. The objective of this study was to investigate the clinical validity and reliability of an acute pain scale (UPAPS) adapted for newborn piglets undergoing castration. Thirty-nine male piglets (five days of age, 1.62 ㊣ 0.23 kg BW) served as their own control, were enrolled in the study and underwent castration in conjunction with an injectable analgesic administered one-hour post-castration (flunixin meglumine 2.2 mg/kg IM). An additional 10, non-painful female piglets were included to account for the effect of natural behavioral variation by day on pain scale results. Behavior of each piglet was video recorded continuously at four recording periods (24 h pre-castration, 15 min post-castration, 3 and 24 h post-castration). Pre- and post-operative pain was assessed by using a 4-point scale (score 0每3) including the following six behavioral items: posture, interaction and interest in surroundings, activity, attention to the affected area, nursing, and miscellaneous behavior. Behavior was assessed by two trained blinded observers and statistical analysis was performed using R software. Inter-observer agreement was very good (ICC = 0.81). The scale was unidimensional based on the principal component analysis, all items except for nursing were representative (<italic toggle=""yes"">r</italic><sub><italic toggle=""yes"">s</italic></sub> ≡ 0.74) and had excellent internal consistency (Cronbach＊s alpha ≡ 0.85). The sum of scores were higher in castrated piglets post-procedure compared to pre-procedure, and higher than in non-painful female piglets confirming responsiveness and construct validity, respectively. Scale sensitivity was good when piglets were awake (92.9%) and specificity was moderate (78.6%). The scale had excellent discriminatory ability (area under the curve &gt; 0.92) and the optimal cut-off sum for analgesia was 4 out of 15. The UPAPS scale is a valid and reliable clinical tool to assess acute pain in castrated pre-weaned piglets.</p></abstract>","[

abstract,8,,PMC8884462,"<abstract><p>Colonic lipomas (CLs) are a rare benign neoplasm of the gastrointestinal tract and the second most common tumor of the colon after adenomatous polyps. The clinical presentation of lipomas depends on the size of the tumor. Lesions that are less than 2 cm are mostly asymptomatic and are incidental findings during procedures like colonoscopies, imaging, or surgery. CLs that are greater than 2 cm can present with abdominal pain, nausea, intestinal obstruction, diarrhea, bleeding, and intussusception. Barium enema and colonoscopy can provide diagnostic clues; however, abdominal computed tomography (CT) confirms the diagnosis. Treatment modalities range from observation?to segmental colectomy and endoscopic or laparoscopic procedures. Surgical resection is preferred for CLs that are either?symptomatic or greater than 2 cm. Giant lipomas are often symptomatic and amenable to treatment, with surgical resection, laparoscopy, and endoscopic resection being the preferred treatment modalities.

Surfaces were then converted into spots by first applying the distance transformation function which effectively generates a channel based on the surface volumes. The resulting channels were then the basis for generating spots that more accurately correspond to the initial surface segmentation. The spots function was used to evaluate average distance to neighboring objects within categories, as well as determining the average shortest distance between size categories. In the spot function, distances are calculated between the center of mass of any two objects. A similar pipeline for comparison between human and mouse INS+ islet distribution was carried out on five 10-week-old male C57BL/6J control mice from a pre-processed and segmented public dataset24.

To experimentally increase Zeb1 levels we made use of the indZeb1 knock-in allele (R26-Zeb1tg), harboring Zeb1-HA cDNA driven by the Rosa26 locus42 activated by Pdx1-Cre in indZeb1 mice (Fig. 4A). To our surprise, these mice died shortly after birth showing severe growth retardation with only a few individuals reaching 2每7 weeks of age (Fig. 4B, C), due to pancreas agenesis to variable extend and sporadic cyst formation. This observation was combined with more severe reduction of the islet mass (Fig. 4C). To discriminate whether moderate elevation of Zeb1 expression impaired pancreas specification or affected cell survival later, we analyzed E15.5 embryos, when the secondary transition was almost completed in control embryos. Although the size of the embryonic pancreas was slightly reduced, all indZeb1 embryos displayed a clearly discernible pancreas with proper gross morphology but included sporadic cystic or blood-filled structures (Fig. 4D). Zeb1 overexpression was confirmed by immunofluorescence staining, showing expression at the detection limit, with a few patches of more robust expression (Fig. 4E and inset). We observed a slight global reduction in the expression of the Zeb1 target E-cad with almost negative patches of higher Zeb1 levels in mutant embryos (Fig. 4D). mRNA analysis of pancreata from embryos and pups confirmed a moderate 1.5 and 3-fold increase in Zeb1 transcripts resulting in lower Cdh1 and higher Vim levels in indZeb1, whereas Zeb1 depletion had no robust effect (Fig. 4F).","[

reference-text,7,schema,PMC7916718,"The expansion of islet macrophages in obesity conditions is accompanied by a transcriptional reprogramming. Nackiewicz and colleagues reported an increase in islet macrophages in 8-week-old obese and diabetic db/db mice. Gene transcription analysis showed the induction of Igf1 and reduction in IL6 and Tnf gene expression, supporting the hypothesis that obesity triggers a switch to a macrophage reparative state, probably in response to increased 汕-cell death [27]. Indeed, the same gene expression profile was observed after administration of streptozotocin, an antineoplastic agent with specific toxicity for pancreatic 汕-cells, alone or in combination with a high-fat diet (HFD) [27]. Another recent report confirmed the expansion of islet macrophages in HFD-induced obesity and in db/db mice [71]. In this report, transcriptomic analysis unveiled a peculiar macrophage activation profile, in which only some pro-inflammatory genes were upregulated, whereas others were even downregulated. In addition, the expression of a subset of M2 macrophage-specific genes was decreased. These observations demonstrate that islet macrophages are highly specialised and present specific phenotypes in response to their microenvironment, rather than a classic pro-inflammatory activation profile. Ying and colleagues further analysed the effect of islet macrophage expansion in obesity [71]. Co-culture with macrophages derived from obese mice impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from clonal Min6 汕-cells [71]. This may be mediated by the uptake of insulin-containing secretory vesicles released from 汕-cells. It has been proposed that direct contact between macrophages and 汕-cells is required for this mechanism, maybe via tunnelling nanotubes transporting cytoplasmic material [79] (Figure 3). In addition, macrophages isolated from obese mice show increased 汕-cell proliferation in a mechanism dependent on PDGF-receptor activation [71].","[

This artery branches into three vessels near the neck of the bladder to supply the bladder, prostate, seminal vesicle and the urethra. The central branch bifurcates - giving off one vessel that runs along the anterior prostate to supply the anterior prostatic ducts and parts of the adjacent seminal vesicle and another vessel that directly supplies the anterior prostate. The dorsal branch supplies the dorsolateral prostate while the ventral branch supplies the ventral surface of the bladder and the ventral prostate. Vessels supplying the ventral and dorsolateral prostate lobes enter near the junction of the main prostate ducts with the urethra and arborize as they extend distally (Figure 1C and D).

reference-text,9,schema,PMC1809596,"Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease, where lymphocytes destroy the insulin producing 汕-cells of the pancreatic islets of Langerhans. The development of T1D is influenced by multiple genetic and environmental factors of which most remain unknown. The non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse strain [1] spontaneously develops a disease very similar to human T1D, and constitutes a major animal model used for investigating the cause of autoimmune diabetes [2,3]. Disease can be transferred by T lymphocytes, demonstrating that these cells are central to T1D development, but other immune cells such as B cells, dendritic cells, macrophages and possibly natural killer (NK) cells are also known to play an important role in diabetes pathogenesis. The autoimmune activities leading to disease progress over a relatively long period of time, and have been described to transit discrete checkpoints [4] (Fig. 1). As early as around 2 weeks after birth, the pancreas experiences a wave of 汕-cell death (Fig. 1a), also occurring in non-diabetic mouse strains, leading to the presentation of pancreas-derived antigens in the draining pancreatic lymph nodes [5] (Fig. 1b). In the NOD mouse, this leads to the stimulation of autoreactive T lymphocytes. The insufficiently controlled initiation of T cell autoreactivity, specific for the NOD strain, is regarded as a failure at the first checkpoint. Soon after, at 3每4 weeks of age, leucocytes enter into the pancreas of NOD mice (Fig. 1c). As insulitis proceeds, cells continue to accumulate around the islets, initially as a peri-islet infiltrate (Fig. 1d). The transformation from this benign state to invasive infiltration and 汕-cell destruction is seen as passage through the second checkpoint (Fig. 1e). When more than 90% of the islets have been destroyed and insulin production is too low to regulate blood glucose levels, diabetes precipitates occurring from around 12 weeks of age (Fig. 1f). At 25每30 weeks of age, around 80% of female NOD mice have been affected (Fig. 1g). Insulitis develops in both female and male NOD mice; however, only 20每30% of the male mice become diabetic, suggesting that the second checkpoint is more effective in males.","[

figure-caption,9,schema,PMC4426478,"(A) Squamous epithelia consist of layers of keratinocytes, SCs (green) reside in the basal cell layer, along with post-mitotic cells waiting to stratify (red). When a differentiating cell leaves the niche (arrow), a nearby SC divides with one of the three division outcomes shown to maintain constant cell density in the niche. The probabilities of each outcome (expressed as per cent, oesophageal epithelium shown) are balanced, so equal numbers of SCs and differentiated cells are produced across the population. (B) The hair follicle cycles between a resting stage (telogen) and expansion of the lower follicle (anagen). Multiple SCs have been identified, in the junctional zone (purple), the bulge (green) and the hair germ (blue), which lie in contact with the mesenchymal cells of the dermal papilla (blue). The hair shaft (black) is surrounded by concentric layers of inner root sheath cells that have been omitted for clarity. In the transition into anagen, hair germ and upper bulge cells self-duplicate. In the bulge, divisions are aligned parallel with the axis of the hair shaft (inset). Lower bulge cells contribute differentiating progeny to greatly expand the root sheath. Later in anagen, hair germ cells assemble around the dermal papilla and then generate inner root sheath cells (arrows). Self-renewal and differentiation are balanced, so the numbers of SCs in each compartment is maintained at a constant level across multiple hair cycles. (C) Intestinal epithelium contains four lineages sustained by SCs (green) that lie between Paneth cells in the crypt base. Differentiating cells migrate through a progenitor compartment in the upper crypt from which post-mitotic cells populate the villus, from which they are shed. Inset shows a simplified top-down view of the niche. As a differentiating SC exits the niche, it is replaced by the self-duplicating division of an immediately adjacent SC. (D) Heamatopoietic SCs reside close to blood vessels in the bone marrow. Dormant SCs (green) lie close to arterioles, receiving paracrine signals from endothelial cells (red), perivascular cells expressing Ng2 and sympathetic nerve endings (blue). On activation, SCs migrate to be close to venous sinusoids that support Lepr-expressing perivascular cells. (E) Asymmetric fate and symmetric fate of haematopoietic SCs. Transplantation of daughter cells of a single SC reveals self-duplicating and asymmetric divisions: dark green: long-term-reconstituting SCs; light green: short- or intermediate-term-reconstituting SCs; yellow: megakaryocyte progenitor; and blue: common myeloid progenitor. (F) Native haematopoiesis. Lineage tracing in homoeostasis suggests that myeloid lineages may be maintained by self-sustaining progenitor cells (yellow) exhibiting ＆population asymmetry＊ by generating equal proportions of progenitor and differentiating cells (grey) (see inset). Haematopoietic SCs (green) make negligible contribution to myelopoiesis in homoeostasis, but function as ＆reserve＊ cells. (G) Male germ cell SCs are diverse in appearance but functionally equivalent. Male germ cells expressing GFR汐1 reside in the outermost layer of the seminiferous tubule. SCs (green) exist as singles or 2每4 cell syncytia connected by cytoplasmic bridges, which may self-duplicate (blue arrows) to generate two SCs or undergo fragmentation (short red arrows). Upon differentiation (pink arrow) into Ngn3-positive cells (red), the same behaviour continues, but Ngn3+ cells are unlikely to revert to GFR汐1+ SCs in homoeostasis. Once in the Ngn3 compartment, syncytia larger than 4 cells form which may undergo further differentiation into cKit-expressing cells (not shown), which are even less likely to revert to GFR汐1-positive cells. (H) Neural SCs exhibit symmetric and asymmetric cell divisions. Quiescent neural SCs (light green) reside in the subventricular zone niche, extending processes into cerebrospinal fluid (blue) that fills the lateral ventricles (LV) and underlying endothelial cells (red) lining blood vessels (BV). Endothelial cells that line the LV are shown in grey. Differentiating transit amplifying cells (pink) and neural precursor cells (orange) lie adjacent to the SCs. Figure after Silva-Vargas et al (). (I) Division outcomes of neural SCs in the dentate gyrus inferred from lineage tracing. Neural SCs interconvert between quiescent (light green) and proliferating (dark green) states. Division of SCs has a range of symmetric and asymmetric outcomes as shown, generating neural SCs, neuroblasts (orange) or differentiated astrocytes (blue).","[

figure-caption,10,schema,PMC10500611,"Schematic representation of the roles of PfEMP1, cytoadherence and sequestration of infected RBCs in symptomatic and asymptomatic malaria. Left green box: Symptomatic malaria cases during a rainy/transmission season or any symptomatic malaria cases characterized by high parasitemia: in the latter half of 48-hour replicative cycle, parasite-infected RBCs display the surface protein PfEMP1, the primary component mediating adhesion to variable receptors on the endothelial surface of the vasculature within different organs. This leads to sequestration of parasites in the deep tissue capillary beds, thereby avoiding filtration by the spleen. A. Display of PfEMP1 on the surface of infected RBC involves multiple other parasite-produced proteins, including knob associated histidine rich protein (KAHRP), Plasmodium falciparum 332 kd protein (Pf332), and ring expressed surface antigen (RESA). Other proteins displayed on the infected RBC surface include Rifins and Clag3. The specific PfEMP1 receptors on human endothelial cells associated with cerebral malaria include endothelial protein complex receptor (EPCR) and intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), and pregnancy-associated malaria has been linked to the epithelial receptor chondroitin sulfate A (CSA) displayed on the surface of syncytiotrophoblasts, however receptors related to other malaria manifestations remain largely unknown. B. In the human host, P. falciparum asexual replication leads to exponential growth of infected erythrocytes, while less than 20% of parasites commit to sexual development generating female and male gametocytes. During blood meals, female Anopheles mosquitos ingest male and female gametocytes, where they mate, develop and produce sporozoites that will be inoculated into a new human host, thereby perpetuating the parasite＊s life cycle. Due to sequestration and splenic filtration, only the early stages of the asexual cycle (ring stages) are observed in blood smears of symptomatic malaria cases. Right gray box: Asymptomatic malaria cases during a dry season or after a lengthy infection: cases manifest as extremely low parasitemias and routine detection methods (blood smears and PCR) often fail to detect the parasites. In this review, we present a model that parasites not expressing PfEMP1 are primarily responsible for chronic, asymptomatic infections. Non-PfEMP1 expressing parasites lose the ability to cytoadhere, hence parasites numbers are held in check and infected humans don＊t suffer from severe symptoms. C. The vast majority of infected RBCs are filtered and pitted by the spleen. There is evidence that some parasites can complete both sexual and asexual development inside the red pulp, however only infected RBCs that remain deformable, including ring stages and stage V gametocytes, can travel back to the circulation (the function of spleen during malaria infections was comprehensively discussed by Henry et al [54]. D. The bone marrow is another possible reservoir for parasites escaping both immune elimination and spleen clearance. Merozoites are likely the only form that can travel from the sinusoids to the bone marrow parenchyma. In the parenchyma, both asexual and sexually committed merozoites could invade and develop in erythrocyte precursor cells within erythroblastic islands. While orthochromatic cells can support merozoite entry, only enucleating reticulocytes support intracellular parasites growth [43]. Due the loss of deformability, only ring-infected or stage V gametocyte-infected reticulocytes can return to the peripheral blood. Neveu et al. [40] have shown that infection of erythroblasts by gametocytes and parasite-derived extracellular vesicles delay erythroid differentiation, enabling the stage V gametocyte-infected reticulocytes to successfully leave the bone marrow parenchyma, however it is unknown if asexual parasites have a similar mechanism. It is possible that asexual parasites instead tend to stay in the parenchyma where the bone marrow environment promotes sexual commitment. Thus, the bone marrow could serve as a reservoir for gametocytes, with occasional release of ring-infected reticulocytes.","[
