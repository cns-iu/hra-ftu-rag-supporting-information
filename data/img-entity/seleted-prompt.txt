### **Objective**:  

Your task is to extract all relevant biological and biomedical entities from the provided text with a high degree of accuracy. These entities should fall into the following categories:  

- **Genes, Proteins, Pathways, Diseases, Anatomical Structures**  
- **Biological Processes, Mechanisms, Treatments, Symptoms**  
- **Cell Types, Molecular Functions, Cellular Components**  
- **Organisms, Pathogens, Time Points, Temporal Stages**  
- **Enzyme Commission (E.C.) Numbers, Transcription Factors, Compounds, Reactions**  
- **Biomarkers, Food, Medical Devices, Pharmacologic Classes**  
- **Side Effects, Diagnostic Methods, Chemicals, and other specialized biological terms**

### **Instructions for Extraction**:  

1. **Entities Only**: The output must contain only the extracted entities, with no additional text or explanations.  
2. **Maximal Coverage**: Capture all relevant biomedical entities without missing any.  
3. **No Contextual Dependencies**: Extract terms as standalone entities without inferring relationships.  
4. **Domain-Specific Focus**: Only include terms relevant to biology and medicine.  
5. **Text Fidelity**: Ensure the extracted entities match the exact terminology used in the input text.

### **Output Format**:  

Your output should be a structured JSON object as follows:  

```json
{
  "entities": ["Entity1", "Entity2", "Entity3", ...]
}
```
