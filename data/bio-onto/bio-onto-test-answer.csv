Additionally, pattern recognition receptors, such as Toll©\like receptors (TLR), which are crucial for the innate immune recognition and response by Kupffer cells, bind to MAMPs from the intestine and DAMPs, primarily derived from damaged hepatocytes (Figure 1). 22 Upon binding, these MAMPs and DAMPs are phagocytosed and subsequently degraded by Kupffer cells without the production of the inflammatory mediators that usually accompany innate immune signaling. Therefore, the body of the host is protected from excessive immune activation within the liver. However, excessive amounts of immunogenic molecules from gut bacteria, such as LPS or LTA, alter immunogenic responses to inflammatory reactions with TLR4 and TLR2, respectively (Figures 1 and 3). Similarly, bacteria©\derived DNA mediate immune activation via TLR9. These TLRs function as primary drivers of inflammatory responses in liver disease. Additionally, TLR signaling in Kupffer cells activates the downstream proinflammatory cascade, leading to MyD88©\mediated activation of NF©\kB. 20","{

The thymus consists of two lobes that are separated by connective tissue strands (trabeculae) in lobules. Each thymic lobule consisted of the cortex and medulla. The cortex contains CD34+ uncommitted pluripotent hematopoietic precursor cells (HPCs) entering the thymus at the cortico-medullary junction (CMJ) and migrating to the capsule, committed double negative (DN) CD4?CD8? T precursor cells (TPCs) located in the subcapsular region (DN1¨CDN4 stages), and immature double positive (DP) CD4+CD8+ (Pre-DP) cortical thymocytes migrating through the cortex and CMJ to the medullar zone. The medulla contains single positive (SP) CD4+ and CD8+ na?ve thymocytes migrating to the periphery after maturing. Stromal-epithelial compartment of the thymus is submitted by minor populations of EpCam+ (CD326+) Foxn1+ bipotent thymic epithelial precursor cells/thymic epithelial stem cells (TEPCs/TESCs), and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) located probably into the thymic parenchyma close to the CMJ region, as well as EpCam+CD205+ cortical thymic epithelial cells (cTECs) located in the cortex and EpCam+Air+ medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) located in the medulla. The cortex and medulla also contain macrophages (MFs), fibroblasts (Fbs), and dendritic cells (DCs) that, together with cTECs and mTECs, participate in the differentiation, maturation, and positive and negative selection of thymocytes. T cell and ILC lineages diverge at the stages of early T precursors/double negative 1 (ETP/DN1) and the DN2-DN3 transition stage. Depending on the status of the TCR loci, the strength of Notch signaling and activities of E-ld proteins and Bcl11b, multipotent TLPs may develop conventional ¦Á¦Â T cells or acquire innate-like properties and give rise to thymic natural killer (NK) cells, DCs, granulocytes, B cells, one of three ILC subsets and invariant ¦Ã¦Ä T cells.

H+-ATPase B1/2 was mainly expressed in some cells in the cortical collecting ducts (CCDs) and outer medullary collecting ducts (OMCDs) under basal conditions (Fig 6A and 6D). HCl loading increased the expression of H+-ATPase B1/2 and caused the hypertrophy of cells expressing H+-ATPase B1/2, suggesting that the cells are intercalated cells (Fig 6B, 6C, 6E and 6F) [43]. Ubiquitin was expressed in the nucleus of cells along the nephron, but not in the peritubular cells, under basal conditions (Fig 7A and 7D).

reference-text,10,micro,PMC1483230,"In addition to soluble moieties, the intrathymic production of ECM is altered in infectious diseases (Figure 4). By using immunohistochemistry, we found increased deposition of ECM components such as laminin, fibronectin, and type IV collagen in various human and experimental acute infectious diseases, including rabies, syphilis, measles, Chagas disease, and schistosomiasis [32]. One could argue that such an increased in the intrathymic contents of ECM molecules merely reflects the atrophy of the organ, with a densification of the ECM-containing network as a result of thymocyte loss. Although such mechanical response is likely to occur, at least in experimental Chagas disease it does not solely account for the ECM increase, since in vitro T. cruzi infection of cultured thymic epithelial cells, as well as TEC cultures derived from in vivo-infected animals, does result in a enhancement of ECM production [62]. Moreover, it is interesting to note that in thymuses from T. cruzi acutely infected mice, thymocytes exhibit an increase in membrane density of ECM receptors for fibronectin and laminin [63].

reference-text,11,schema,PMC2582196,"NAD(P)H oxidase, as well as other metabolic oxidases such as xanthine oxidase and mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes (I¨CIV), are functional in the kidney (278). However, we and others have identified NAD(P)H oxidase¨Cinduced ROS production as a primary initiator of oxidative stress within the kidney (183, 353, 355, 356). Various cells in the kidney have now been shown to possess a fully functional NAD(P)H oxidase system, which produces O2¡¤? free radicals under stimulation by cues such as Ang II, agonists that bind to D1-like receptors, and to H+ fluxes (28, 89, 146, 184, 259, 353, 377, 384) (Figs. 6 through 9). Nox4 is expressed at high levels in kidney and other Noxs, including Nox1, Nox2, and Nox-regulatory subunits, are expressed at lower but quantitatively significant levels (4, 78, 146, 214, 244, 259, 303) making Nox enzymes attractive candidates for the origin of renal ROS, including the relatively high levels of H2O2 seen in urine (172). No consensus appears to exist for the corticomedullary differences between the different subunits, as the literature has data from different animals undergoing different treatments. Indeed, a few studies demonstrated no or very little expression of the regulatory subunits in the medulla. However, one report shows that, in SHRs, the expression of Nox1, Nox2, and p67phox is higher in the renal medulla as compared with the cortex, and the expression of Nox4 and p22phox is higher in the cortex than in the medulla (291). Per this group, the expression of p47 is about the same in the cortex versus medulla. The mesangial cells are unique in that they express Nox1, Nox4, and p22phox, p47phox, and p67phox, but not Nox2 (86, 127, 146, 164, 214, 223, 371, 380) (Fig. 6). This may be biologically important, as some data support the fact that mesangial cells may be similar to VSMCs, which also lack Nox2 (expressed at very low levels) (Stockand et al.). In mesangial cells, NO inhibits the expression of Nox1, suggesting cross-talk between NO and O2¡¤?-generating systems (244). p22phox, p47phox, and p67phox are all expressed in the PCT, DCT, CCD, and the macula densa cells (12, 72, 107, 139, 148, 342, 366) (Fig. 6). Nox2 expression has been shown in the PCT and CCD; Nox4, in the PCT and DCT; whereas Nox1 expression is confined to the PCT, once again demonstrating differential regulation of redox control within the cortex. In situ hybridization experiments initially localized Nox4 mRNA expression to the renal cortex, whereas the medulla showed much lower expression (244, 303). However, immunohistochemical studies also demonstrate Nox4 expression in distal portions of the human nephron, and Nox4 mRNA has been demonstrated in medullary collecting ducts (244, 303). Moreover, as mentioned earlier, the data for Nox4 were obtained from different animal groups. The Nox4 isoform of NAD(P)H oxidase is unique in that it also can use NADH as the substrate for generating O2¡¤? (173). This may be relevant to the kidneys, as the cortex and outer medulla preferentially use NADH as a substrate and express Nox4 at high levels in these regions (387).","{

CCl4 is a well characterized carcinogen that causes centrilobular destruction of hepatocytes and triggers mature hepatocytes to proliferate and reconstitute the lost liver mass (Figure 1A) [27], [28]. Other agents such as DDC have also been reported to cause liver damage associated with the proliferation of oval cells in the periportal area of the hepatic lobule, however, as of yet have not been reported to be carcinogens (Figure 1A) [29]¨C[31]. Here we show that both DDC and CCl4 similarly facilitate MYC-induced initiation of hepatocyte proliferation and tumorigenesis in the adult liver. Our findings suggest a model whereby external stimuli may unveil latent oncogene activation in the mature liver.","{

reference-text,14,schema,PMC8021898,"To understand how famotidine may act to reduce pulmonary COVID-19 symptoms requires an understanding of COVID-19 lung pathophysiology, which appears to have two principal disease phases. In turn, this requires an appreciation of pulmonary tissue and cell types. Pulmonary edema results from loss of a regulation of fluid transfer that occurs at several levels in the alveolus, as diagrammed in Figure 8. In the capillary wall, there are the glycocalyx, the endothelial cell with associated tight junctions, and the basement membrane. In the epithelium there is a surfactant layer on the alveolar lining fluid, manufactured and secreted by the Type II pneumocyte, and the Type I pneumocyte itself with its tight junctions and negatively charged basement membrane which restricts albumin. The pulmonary pericytes located in the terminal conducting airway region play a critical role in synthesizing the endothelial basement membrane and regulating blood flow in the precapillary arteriole, the capillary and the postcapillary venule. Disruption of any of these cells or layers can lead to edema. This edema fluid may be a transudate in milder dysfunctions or an exudate when inflammation or necrosis develop. Two possible pathologies that could result in edema of the alveolar wall and space include infection of cells by SARS-CoV-2 and mast cell degranulation with release of hundreds of compounds that can impact on cellular and basement membrane functions, glycocalyx and tight junction integrity. These compounds include histamine, bradykinin, heparin, tryptase and cytokines.","{

reference-text,15,schema,PMC9452644,"Human pancreas is a unique and complex organ that contains both exocrine and endocrine tissues. The exocrine part accounts for 98% of the organ parenchyma and secretes pancreatic juice into the duodenum for correct digestion and assimilation of nutrients (27). The endocrine compartment represents the remaining 2%. The endocrine side is organized into independent cluster units (27) scattered throughout the exocrine parenchyma, best known as the islet of Langerhans (27,28). They are embedded within a capsule consisting of an extracellular matrix (ECM) and fibroblasts, in which endocrine cells are non randomly aggregated. Islets are independently fed by a dense network of highly fenestrated capillaries, which allows each endocrine cell to be in close contact with the blood (28). Specific organization of the ECM, cells, and microvasculature consitutes the endocrine niche (Figure 1). Owing to the evaluation of the endocrine niche, it was possible to identify the fundamental features useful for bioengineering endocrine pancreatic tissues. Thus, the role of each component will be briefly reviewed, identifying it as an essential part of the niche microenvironment that synergistically supports endocrine functions.","{

Viruses, fungi, mycobacteria and parasites can also infect the prostate and incite inflammation. The figure represents two prostate cells infected either by bacteria or viruses. b | Hormones. Hormonal alterations such as oestrogen exposure at crucial developmental junctures can result in architectural alterations in the prostate that produce an inflammatory response. c | Physical trauma. Corpora amylacea can traumatize the prostate on a microscopic level. The figure shows a corpora within a prostatic acinus in which its edges appear to be eroding the epithelium, resulting in an increase in expression of the stress enzyme cyclooxygenase 2 (PTGS2), represented by brown immunostaining. Prostate cell nuclei are visible in violet following haematoxylin staining. d | Urine reflux. Urine that travels up back towards the bladder (¡®retrograde¡¯ movement) can penetrate the ducts and acini of the prostate. Some compounds, such as crystalline uric acid, can directly activate innate inflammatory cells. Although these compounds would not be expected to traverse the prostate epithelium, if the epithelium was already damaged this would facilitate the leakage of these compounds into the stromal space where they would readily activate inflammatory cells. e | Dietary habits. Ingested carcinogens (for example 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP), which derives from charred meat) can reach the prostate through the bloodstream or by urine reflux and cause DNA damage and mutations, and result in an influx of inflammatory cells.","{

reference-text,17,schema,PMC11312048,"Moreover, our study showed that NSO can regulate the pathway associated with hair growth development, as evidenced by the upregulation of MAPK, FGF, and mTOR after NSO treatment (Figure 4b). In HF, the MAPK protein is involved in regulating root tip growth, stimulating proliferation, and inducing and prolonging the growth period [40]. The mTOR pathway regulates cell proliferation and cycle development in the hair cycle by interacting with the MAPK pathway [41]. The interactions and communication in these pathways continue throughout the hair growth cycle. In our investigation, the NSO extract actively stimulated the DPC growth-related gene FGF2. FGF2 sustains the high proliferation and multipotency of mesenchymal stem cells derived from human hair follicles, which is necessary for promoting the growth phase and HF morphogenesis [42]. Hydrogen peroxide can cause cell damage by producing ROS, which can downregulate cell growth, accelerate the cell aging process, and ultimately lead to hair loss [43]. In this study, we chose to treat DPCs with 200 ¦ÌM H2O2 for 1.5 h, and then significant changes were observed in the cell survival rate and ROS production. TXNRD2 eliminates free radicals by increasing the SOD, CAT, and GSH levels, thereby reducing ROS content [44]. In different types of vascular cells, HMOX1 converts cellular heme into carbon monoxide (CO), biliverdin, and Fe2+, which is crucial in the fight against inflammation, oxidative damage, apoptosis, and thrombosis [45]. As a key cytoplasmic peroxidation inhibitor protein, the lack of GPX4 enhances cellular lipid peroxidation. Iron accumulation, cytotoxic ROS, and lipid oxidation are characteristics of ferroptosis, and the inactivation of or reduction in GPX4 will lead to ferroptosis [46]. Research has shown that ferroptosis inhibitors can protect cells from damaging cell stress or prevent cell death by increasing GPX4 expression [47]. The inhibition and imbalance of genes associated with hair growth lead to an early entry into the regression period and a longer resting period, leading to hair loss eventually. The results show that NSO promotes cell proliferation and resists oxidative damage by regulating genes related to the proliferation (FGF2, MAPK3, and AKT2) and antioxidation (TXNRD2, HMOX1, GPX4) of DPC (Figure 4c and Figure 8).","{

The effector sites are composed of the lamina propria (LP), which lies below the basement membrane in the intestinal villi, and the intraepithelial compartment, which contains intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) and is located just above the basement membrane juxtaposed between columnar epithelial cells. Intestinal inductive sites are composed of a network of Peyer¡¯s patches, which are organized lymphoid structures (akin to lymph nodes) embedded in the gut wall and the draining mesenteric lymph nodes. The LP, PP, and IEL lymphoid populations form a complex, interconnected network that responds to immunological insults in the intestine (Mowat, 2003; Sheridan and Lefrancois, 2010, 2011). Therefore, these lymphocyte populations should be analyzed when studying the immunological status of the intestine, for example in oral immunization, inflammatory bowel disease, infection, or tumors.","{

reference-text,19,schema,PMC5486072,"Splenic sinuses are unique structures different from conventional capillaries. They are essentially cavities lined up by a discontinuous endothelium. Endothelial cells are disposed in parallel, hence delimiting narrow slits that represent the anatomical site where the sieving activity of the spleen is exerted (Figure 1A). Splenic sinuses continue in venules that anastomose to form veins of progressively larger caliber. Splenic cords are cavities inside the stroma of the red pulp that are filled up by red and white cells. Splenic cords are not lined by endothelium, but represent a specialization of the stroma and, as such, are delimited by fibroblasts and extracellular matrix. Red blood cells in splenic cords have to squeeze across the splits of the splenic sinusoids to return to the general circulation (Figure 1A). Aged and diseased erythrocytes that are not deformable enough to cross these slits are retained in the red pulp and destroyed [8]. As we will discuss later, this is also a mechanism involved in nanoparticle sequestration by the spleen. There has been a long controversy on how the splenic sinuses and cords are fed by the penicillary arteries in human spleen. For a long time, the prevalent model has been that penicillary arteries open up in the red pulp with no direct continuity with the wall of sinuses, hence making an open circulatory system in which blood may freely exit from the arterial compartment [9,10]. Further studies suggested instead that penicillary arteries directly continue in sinuses (closed circulation models), and combined models in which both open and closed circulation coexist were proposed, as well. In 2011, Steiniger et al. reported a detailed 3D reconstruction of red pulp vessels of the human spleen showing that virtually all of the circulation was of an open type [7]. Furthermore, another area of controversy concerning the blood supply of the white pulp has been recently addressed by 3D reconstruction studies. Kusumi et al. [11] showed that different from what was suggested by previous evidence, the central arteries do not directly contribute to the vascularization of the white pulp. The white pulp is, instead, irrorated by harpin loop arterioles emerging from the penicillary artery; after that, it leaves the follicle or the lymphoid sheath surrounding the central artery. An important contribution also comes from the central arteries of neighbor follicles. The arterioles that emerge from the penicillary arteries and those that come from neighbor follicles give rise to discontinuous capillary-like structures, the marginal sinuses, at the junction between the red and the white pulp (Figure 1B). This region known as the marginal zone (MZ) is well defined in rats and mice, but not in humans [5]. MZ is populated by resident IgM+/IgD? memory B lymphocytes, and it is easily identifiable in histological preparations, being demarcated by a uniform population of metallophilic macrophages (Figure 1B).
